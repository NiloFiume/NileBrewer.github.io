                        <p class="project_intro"><br> I built this new transformer from ground up. This includes:
                            <br><br>
                            1. Isolating the 25,000V source.
                            <br>
                            2. Pouring the concrete pad.
                            <br>
                            3. Running the 1/0 AWG stranded cable.
                            <br>
                            4. Landing the transformer.
                            <br>
                            5. Wiring the transformer to step down the 25KV to 480V.
                            <br>
                            6. Finaly, reenergizing the isolated section to confirm operation and phase.

                        <p class="project_intro"><br> This is a 480V disconnect that I built to isolate a snowmaking
                            system
                            from the source. This enables safe work on the equipment while it is powered down. This
                            picture as well as the transformer is to show that I believe in clean work. Well built
                            systems are easier to inspect and maintain.
                            <br><br>
                            I believe that good craftsmanship says a lot about the technician who built it.

                            Oscilloscope (pictured above), and also industrial Fluke equipment. I have all my own hand

                            years and never properly tracked or mapped. As I located, I collected and catologed GPS
                            cooordinates for each hub. I later built a Google based overlay for visual confirmation that
                            could be used in conjunction with my schematic drawing.

                            operations are often in tight time restraints due to equipment and/or material availability.
