            <h2>Work and Education:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I have a degree in Computer Engineering and graduated with honors (cum laude,
                    3.64).</li>
                <li>I have a degree in Environmental Geology.</li>
                <li>I am an excelent communicator and self motivated.</li>
                <li>I have hands on experience building electrical systems, high voltage 25000volts and
                    24v control systems.</li>
                <li>I have experience in troubleshooting electrical systems.</li>
                <li>I mapped the entire high voltage distribution system for my company. The original build had 20 years
                    of improvement and expansion that no one had tracked. I used a locator to find all of the
                    underground high voltage and mapped the entire system using GPS locations. I then made a new
                    schematic and a google overlay to confirm visually. </li>
                <li>I brought my company up to code by incorporating all the OSHA required equipment and training. </li>
                <li>Fun fact: I'm the only person I know that has perfect attendance in college, I'm not sure if I
                    should actually brag about that..., but I would hope is shows character and commitment.</li>


            </ul>
            <h2>Personal:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I am well traveled, having lived in many countries including Australia, New Zealand, Italy and
                    Switzerland. I have traveled to many more.
                </li>
                <li>I am a tandem instructor and fly paragliders and hang gliders. A good pilot must be great under
                    pressure and be able to pay attention to details even under the most stressful conditions.</li>
                <li>I was recognized at my work for being 1 of only 2 people that had NEVER called in sick or showed up
                    to work late.</li>
                <li>The Italian language is another passion of mine. I have spent a lot of time in Italy and before the
                    pandemic I went there once a year.</li>
