            <hr>
        <p>My primary duty was to
            troubleshooting control systems and high voltage transmission. I also have experience with heavy
            machinery, mechanical equipment and heavy rigging.</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>I have a degree in Computer Engineering and graduated with honors (cum laude,
                    3.64).</li>
                <li>I have hands on experience with electrical systems, high voltage 25000volts and
                    control systems.
                </li>
                <li>I am well traveled, having lived in Australia, New Zealand, Italy and Switzerland.
                </li>
                <li>I am an excelent communicator and self motivated.</li>
                <li>I'm the only person I know that has perfect attendance in college, front row. I
                    think that says a
                    lot about my dedication to the ventures I commit myself to.</li>
                <li>I am a tandem instructor and fly paragliders and hang gliders. What this says about
                    me: I'm good
                    under pressure and I can pay attention to details even under the most stressful conditions.</li>
                <li>My work ethic and good disposition are hard to find. I'm a team player! We start
                    together, and I'll
                    be there until it's complete.</li>
