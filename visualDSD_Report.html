                        <t></t>Abstract—DNA computing is a growing area of research and an important conversation in the
                        tech world. It is complex and for most seems out of reach. Side by side with quantum computing,
                        it is one of the most interesting and pivotal discussion pieces for the future of engineering
                        and computer science. Some people think you need dueling PhD’s, one in organic chemistry and
                        another in computer engineering to understand this subject. The purpose of this research was to
                        discover if the barriers to entry were indeed that high and additionally to put the required
                        information for DNA computing in one place. High barriers for entry are a common reason that
                        some industries and their progress is stunted. This paper aims to simplify that.

                        There are big differences when comparing DNA and traditional computing. With traditional
                        computing, bits are inspected for their state. The presence or absence of voltage will indicate
                        1 or 0 respectively [3]. This state will determine how programs or gates are interpreted.

                        In DNA computing, the presence or absence of the four nucleotides, the base pair, determine the
                        state. The base pair (bound by their backbone of phosphate and sugar) are Adenine, Thymine,
                        Guanine and Cytosine [14]. The process and ease by which these nucleotides are synthesized
                        (converted to meaningful code) is slow and arduous. The efficacy of DNA computing has been
                        proven, while it is slow and expensive, the benefits are vast. Some of the benefits include
                        longevity and space required to store data.

                        My contribution is to research DNA computing and a functional understanding for programming and
                        simulating DNA. Helping determine what knowledge is required for coding DNA and what is not.
                        There is a plethora of lateral knowledge with regards to DNA computing, not all of which is
                        required.

                        Terms like hybridization, species, base pair and toehold are simpler than one would think and
                        only a basic understanding of them is required to make functional DNA code. In this paper the
                        reader will be given the general idea of how DNA works, what the keywords are and what they
                        mean. After that, the reader will be given a basic understanding of how DNA is coded using
                        Microsoft’s Visual DSD (DNA Strand Displacement) and Visual CRN (Chemical Reaction Network).
                        These languages were developed and are supported by Microsoft as a means to simulate DNA
                        computation without the expensive and complex tasks related to biological experimentation.

                        Regardless of the outcome of this industry, good things will develop from DNA computing. As with
                        NASA, space travel is far from the only benefit that came from their research and development.
                        We can assume the same will be true here.

                        I. INTRODUCTION
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Most papers written on DNA computation start or finish with the story of Leonard Adleman, one of
                        the first researchers that studied DNA computation [8]. Adleman solved a seven step Hamilton
                        path problem with DNA computing. Hamilton’s path is a problem of getting from starting vertex to
                        finishing vertex while only visiting each one, once. Below is a Hamilton’s seven steps problem
                        going from 1 and finishing with 5.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Fig. 1. 7 step Hamilton path problem. [10]
                        <br>
                        Don’t get lost in the problem, the path in the case in figure 1 would be [1, 4, 7, 2, 3, 6, 5].
                        What is impressive is not the problem, it is the type of problem. This problem is what is
                        referred to as an NP problem (nondeterministic). An NP problem is a problem that is difficult to
                        answer but easy to check the result. Imagine finding the combination to a padlock, if there were
                        4 number options, you would have 10 thousand possible combinations. Once the answer is found,
                        confirmation is easy. You are likely to find more than one wrong answer on the way to the
                        correct one. This is what makes the problem impressive to the tech crowd. DNA computing can also
                        solve SAT questions (Boolean satisfiability problems) some say these are also qualified as
                        NP-complete. [7] If these problems are solved by checking multiple paths simultaneously, the
                        time savings could be astronomical.
